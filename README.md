# Quize

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.5.
I want the application to be based on Pack and (Jason Server)
For the application to work, the Jason server must be on (30001)
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
